CTF is a team game, so play like you're a part of the team instead of trying to hero it. The hero approach only works on pubs and low level pickup topics. When your teammate needs help, help him, don't ignore him no matter the position you play. Chances are that he's not spamming for help because he's bored, but because he's fucked, and if he's a def, your team is fucked along with him if you don't help out. 

Follow team overlay and team indicators, it's almost like having a wall hack on if you can utilize it properly. Don't take items that are not intended for your role in team or if the current situation in game requires for someone else to take the items you usually should (e.g. cross cap). Communicate with your team, bind some basics like where from the enemy is coming, when you are ready to attack, when the power up is about to spawn. Have drop flag, drop powerup and drop weapon binded, you never know when you might need to get rid of flag or share a weapon.

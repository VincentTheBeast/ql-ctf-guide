Here are some basic binds you really should have if you ever decide to play in a pickup game.

```bind <key> "say_team ^1[^3 ENEMY IN/OUT LOW ^1]"  
bind <key> "say_team ^1[^3 ENEMY IN/OUT HIGH ^1]"  
bind <key> "say_team ^1[^3 ENEMY IN/OUT WATER ^1]"  
bind <key> "say_team ^1[^3 READY TO ATTACK ^1]"  
bind <key> "say_team ^1[^3 POWERUP ^1]"  
bind <key> "say_team ^1[^3 BASE LOST ^1]"  
bind <key> "droppowerup"
bind <key> "dropflag"
```

You can also include some tokens to your binds, like `#h` and `#a` that echo your current health and armor levels to the team. You could also expand the bind list with a bind that says a certain item is up or taken, etc.

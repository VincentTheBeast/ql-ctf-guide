# Overview
Being one of the newer, Quake Live exclusive maps, Infinity is only played because of zealous wish of some people in QL CTF community to have new maps in the map pool. A mid heavy map benefiting mostly the “tdm” and “+back” teams.

## Defense
Infinity is one of the new maps so the guide might certainly be updated in the future. The def’s current role is to control his mega (35 sec timer) while he gets his front ya and optionally, the lower ya. The reason for it being optional is because if for any reason an enemy comes in from high while the def is taking his low ya, there is a big chance he will either die or get pushed back down by the enemy because the only proper way to get back up is with the jump pad.

Due to the recent map change it is no longer quite possible for the def to get rg easily so his teammates should be dropping him one. Only during major pushes by his teammates can the def move out to get rg himself.

Infinity is still a def heavy map because of the numerous spawns in base and ease for anyone to stop the enemy fc if they are in the vicinity. This means that even in pickups it’s sometimes acceptable to have a stacked def use mid pu (usually brought to him) to try to break through the heavy def of opposite team. This is an improvisation tactic in pickups and a def should only do so if his team decides to drop him the powerup and not decide to do this on his own unless he is certain his team knows what he is doing. If the def has a rail he can help mid occasionally by railing from low entrance under ya jump pad, but this has to be done very carefully and the main focus should be around flag area.

As far as the positioning and spam goes, rotation of mega, flag room high, high front ya, and flag room low ya, rarely helping mid from low entrance under high front ya. Grenades can be used in the flag room extensively if it is known that enemy is approaching from mega side or the high front entrance as both these places are narrow and suitable for grenade spam.

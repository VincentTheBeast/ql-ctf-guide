# Overview
One more map hailing from the notorious threewave pack. Known as p5 back in Q3, it didn’t really get the community love in QL, and is mostly labeled as boring and masochistic.

## Defense
Shining forces is a straightforward def map. The def will control his ya + shards while generally behind his flag with rg out. While taking his ya he can also support the mid ra position by landing a few rails on the enemy there. The def will also help with rg from high at mid pu times but making sure there is nobody sneaking on to flag area, it is never recommended to leave high or low entrances to allow for a speedy return to flag area.

Because of the very open spaces in the map it is not open to much spamming but rather def’s rely on rg + lg extensively. The only possible spam area is to shoot rockets down to ya from rl area when it’s known that enemies are approaching from low. The only times the def will support ra or pu is when the high def player is in position and / or the def is aware the route he does not cover is safe, otherwise it is usually not worth the risk. As long as the def has high accuracy with rg + lg, takes his ya, and is in position by the flag while enemies approach it, it is very hard to take him out.

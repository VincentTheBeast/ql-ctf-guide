# Overview
Yet another map coming out of threewave map packs, an old Q3 favourite. Most notable thing on the map is mid which reminds of Campgrounds (dm6), a legendary duel map.

## Defense
Camper Crossings is another straightforward def map. The def is responsible for getting his mega (35 sec timer) and middle corridor ya. His main weapons will be lg and rg which are both placed close by anyway. The only times he will ever leave the base is to fire a few rails at mid from the middle entrance tunnel at gl spawn, then quickly move back to base if anybody passes mid and to help mid pu, but usually from a safe distance to not waste his stack. The usual position to wait in base is on top of flag platform so that the def can use rg under decent cover and use lg if anybody comes close.

Most of the time the def will spent fighting on top of his flag and moving to middle ya/rg side to replenish his armor and railgun ammo. As mentioned above the only other positions he takes is when he gets middle entrance armor and power up times. This map has a very open flag room so a direct approach of rg + lg is usually more beneficial versus rl + gl spamming, few exceptions exists like spamming grenades to someone waiting at the jump pad to lg platform and other small situations that are up to the defâ€™s personal decisions.
